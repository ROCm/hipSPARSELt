# hipSPARSELt

hipSPARSELt is a SPARSE marshalling library, with multiple supported backends.
It sits between the application and a 'worker' SPARSE library, marshalling
inputs into the backend library and marshalling results back to the
application. hipSPARSELt exports an interface that does not require the client
to change, regardless of the chosen backend. Currently, hipSPARSELt supports
[rocSPARSELt](library/src/hcc_detial/rocsparselt) and [NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSELt v0.4](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusparselt)
as backends.

> [!NOTE]
> The published hipSPARSELt documentation is available at [hipSPARSELt](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipSPARSELt/en/latest/index.html) in an organized, easy-to-read format, with search and a table of contents. The documentation source files reside in the hipsparselt/docs folder of this repository. As with all ROCm projects, the documentation is open source. For more information, see [Contribute to ROCm documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/contribute/contributing.html).

## Installing pre-built packages

## Quickstart hipSPARSELt build

### Bash helper build script

The root of this repository has a helper bash script `install.sh` to build and
install hipSPARSELt on Ubuntu with a single command.  It does not take a lot of
options and hard-codes configuration that can be specified through invoking
CMake directly, but it's a great way to get started quickly and can serve as an
example of how to build/install. A few commands in the script need sudo access,
so it may prompt you for a password.

```bash
# Run install.sh script
# Command line options:
#   -h|--help            - prints help message
#   -i|--install         - install after build
#   -d|--dependencies    - install build dependencies
#   -c|--clients         - build library clients too (combines with -i & -d)
#   -g|--debug           - build with debug flag
#   -k|--relwithdebinfo  - build with RelWithDebInfo

./install.sh -dc
```

## Build options

hipSPARSELt provides several build options to customize its behavior:

* `TENSILE_ENABLE_MARKER` (default: OFF): Enables or disables the Tensile marker functionality.
* `HIPSPARSELT_ENABLE_MARKER` (default: ON): Enables or disables the hipSPARSELt marker functionality.

To set these options during the build process, use the following CMake command:

```bash
./install.sh --enable-hipsparselt-marker --enable-tensile-marker
```

## hipSPARSELt interface examples

The hipSPARSELt interface is compatible with cuSPARSELt APIs. Porting a CUDA
application which originally calls the cuSPARSELt API to an application calling
hipSPARSELt API should be relatively straightforward. For example, the
hipSPARSELt matmul interface is

### matmul API

```c
hipsparseStatus_t hipsparseLtMatmul(const hipsparseLtHandle_t*     handle,
                                    const hipsparseLtMatmulPlan_t* plan,
                                    const void*                    alpha,
                                    const void*                    d_A,
                                    const void*                    d_B,
                                    const void*                    beta,
                                    const void*                    d_C,
                                    void*                          d_D,
                                    void*                          workspace,
                                    hipStream_t*                   streams,
                                    int32_t                        numStreams);

```

hipSPARSELt assumes matrix A, B, C, D and workspace are allocated in GPU memory
space filled with data. Users are responsible for copying data from/to the host
and device memory.

## Running tests and benchmark tool

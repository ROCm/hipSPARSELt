**************************************************************************
Installing hipSPARSELt (Linux)
**************************************************************************

Prerequisites
====================================

hipSPARSELt requires a `ROCm-enabled platform <https://rocm.github.io/>`_ and the
`hipSPARSE ROCm library <https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipSPARSE>`_ (for the header file).

Installing pre-built packages
==================================

Install hipSPARSELt from the
`ROCm repository <https://rocm.github.io/ROCmInstall.html#installing-from-amd-rocm-repositories>`_.

For detailed instructions on how to set up ROCm on different platforms, refer to the
`ROCm Linux installation guide <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/develop/tutorials/install/linux/index.html>`_.

Using Ubuntu as an example, hipSPARSELt can be installed using

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install hipsparselt

Once installed, hipSPARSELt can be used just like any other library with a C API.

The header file must be included in the user code in order to make calls into hipSPARSELt. The
hipSPARSELt shared library will become link-time and run-time dependent for the user application.

Building hipSPARSELt from source
======================================================

Although you can build from source, it's not necessary--hipSPARSELt can be used after installing the
pre-built packages described above. If you still want to build from source, use the following
instructions.

.. note::

    The following compile-time dependencies must be met:

    * `hipSPARSE <https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipSPARSE>`_
    * `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_
    * `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ 3.5 or later
    * `AMD ROCm <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm>`_
    * (Optional, for clients) `googletest <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_

Download hipSPARSELt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The hipSPARSELt source code is available on our
`GitHub page <https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipSPARSELt>`_

Download the develop branch using:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone -b develop https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipSPARSELt.git
    cd hipSPARSELt

Build library packages, including dependencies and clients
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We recommended installing hipSPARSELt using the ``install.sh`` script.

1. Using ``install.sh`` to build hipSPARSELt with dependencies:

    The following table lists common uses of ``install.sh`` to build dependencies + library.

    .. csv-table::
        :widths: 25, 75
        :header: "Command", "Description"

        "``./install.sh -h``", "Print help information."
        "``./install.sh -d``", "Build dependencies and library in your local directory. The `-d` flag only needs to be used once. For subsequent invocations of ``install.sh``, it's not necessary to rebuild the dependencies."
        "``./install.sh``", "Build library in your local directory. It is assumed dependencies are available."
        "``./install.sh -i``", "Build library, then build and install hipSPARSELt package in ``/opt/rocm/hipsparselt``. You will be prompted for sudo access. This will install for all users."

2. Using ``install.sh`` to build hipSPARSELt with dependencies and clients:

    The client contains example code and unit tests. Common uses of ``install.sh`` to build them are listed in the table below.

    .. csv-table::
        :widths: 25, 75
        :header: "Command", "Description"

        "``./install.sh -h``", "Print help information."
        "``./install.sh -dc``", "Build dependencies, library, and client in your local directory. The `-d` flag only needs to be used once. For subsequent invocations of `install.sh`, it's not necessary to rebuild the dependencies."
        "``./install.sh -c``", "Build library and client in your local directory. It is assumed dependencies are available."
        "``./install.sh -idc``", "Build library, dependencies, and client; then build and install hipSPARSELt package in `/opt/rocm/hipsparselt`. You will be prompted for sudo access. This will install for all users."
        "``./install.sh -ic``", "Build library and client, then build and install hipSPARSELt package in `opt/rocm/hipsparselt`. You will be prompted for sudo access. This will install for all users."

3. Using individual commands to build hipSPARSELt:

.. note::

    CMake 3.16.8 or later is required in order to build hipSPARSELt.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create and change the build directory
    $ mkdir -p build/release ; cd build/release

    # Change default install path (/opt/rocm); use -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path> to adjust the path
    $  cmake ../..

    # Compile the hipSPARSELt library
    $ make -j$(nproc)

    # Install hipSPARSELt to `/opt/rocm`
    $ make install

    GoogleTest is required in order to build hipSPARSELt clients.

    Build hipSPARSELt with dependencies and clients using the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install googletest
    $ mkdir -p build/release/deps ; cd build/release/deps
    $ cmake ../../../deps
    $ make -j$(nproc) install

    # Change to build directory
    $ cd ..

    # Default install path is /opt/rocm, use -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path> to adjust it
    $ cmake ../.. -DBUILD_CLIENTS_TESTS=ON -DBUILD_CLIENTS_SAMPLES=ON

    # Compile hipSPARSELt library
    $ make -j$(nproc)

    # Install hipSPARSELt to /opt/rocm
    $ make install

Testing the installation
==========================================

After successfully compiling the library with clients, you can test the installation by running a hipSPARSELt example:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Navigate to clients binary directory
   $ cd hipSPARSELt/build/release/clients/staging

   # Execute hipSPARSELt example
   $ ./example_spmm_strided_batched -m 32 -n 32 -k 32 --batch_count 1

Running benchmarks & unit tests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run **benchmarks**, hipSPARSELt has to be built with option ``-DBUILD_CLIENTS_BENCHMARKS=ON`` (or using ``./install.sh -c``).

.. code-block:: bash

    # Go to hipSPARSELt build directory
    cd hipSPARSELt/build/release

    # Run benchmark, e.g.
    ./clients/staging/hipsparselt-bench -f spmm -i 200 -m 256 -n 256 -k 256

To run **unit tests**, hipSPARSELt has to be built with option ``-DBUILD_CLIENTS_TESTS=ON`` (or using ``./install.sh -c``)

.. code-block:: bash

    # Go to hipSPARSELt build directory
    cd hipSPARSELt; cd build/release

    # Run all tests
    ./clients/staging/hipsparselt-test
